## What This Is

This is my **personal operating system** for AI-augmented product management. It documents:

- **How I think with AI** — The collaboration model
- **Workflow patterns** — Repeatable processes for common PM tasks
- **Agent modes** — Different AI "personalities" for different jobs
- **Templates** — Starting points for common artifacts

This is not about having AI write your work — it's about **thinking more rigorously** with AI assistance.

## The Core Principle

> **PM work is reconciling four sources of truth. AI helps you explore each faster and spot conflicts. Judgment stays human.**

## Four Sources of Truth

Every PM decision reconciles different types of truth:

```
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│    CODE     │  │    DOCS     │  │    DATA     │  │  JUDGMENT   │
│  Technical  │  │ Contextual  │  │  Empirical  │  │    Human    │
│             │  │             │  │             │  │             │
│ What CAN    │  │ What's      │  │ What IS     │  │ What        │
│ happen?     │  │ expected?   │  │ happening?  │  │ SHOULD?     │
└──────┬──────┘  └──────┬──────┘  └──────┬──────┘  └──────┬──────┘
       │                │                │                │
       └────────────────┴────────┬───────┴────────────────┘
                                 ▼
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │    RECONCILIATION   │
                    └─────────────────────┘
```

| Source | Question Answered |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Code** | "What CAN happen?" |
| **Docs** | "What's EXPECTED?" |
| **Data** | "What IS happening?" |
| **Judgment** | "What SHOULD happen?" |

## Six Agent Modes

| Mode | When to Use | Prompt Prefix |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Analyst** | Codebase exploration | "Act as a rigorous analyst..." |
| **Writer** | Strategy docs | "Help me write a clear..." |
| **Devil's Advocate** | Stress-testing | "Challenge this. Role-play as..." |
| **Builder** | Tools, prototypes | "Build [X] with this spec..." |
| **Thought Partner** | Brainstorming | "Help me explore the space..." |
| **Data Analyst** | Metrics, insights | "Here's [data]. What patterns?" |

## Background

I developed this framework while building clarity for a platform team at Spotify. The team had strong engineering but lacked a clear product identity. Over 4 months, I used AI assistance to:

- Audit 50,000+ lines of code to understand capabilities
- Produce 15+ strategy documents
- Build internal tools
- Prepare for stakeholder conversations

The framework emerged from what actually worked.
