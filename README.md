## What This Is

This is my **personal operating system** for AI-augmented product management. It documents:

- **How I think with AI** — The collaboration model
- **Workflow patterns** — Repeatable processes for common PM tasks
- **Agent modes** — Different AI "personalities" for different jobs
- **Templates** — Starting points for common artifacts

This is not about having AI write your work — it's about **thinking more rigorously** with AI assistance.

## The Core Principle

> **I provide direction, constraints, and judgment. AI provides structure, completeness, and articulation.**

## The Knowledge Mixing Model

Every PM decision mixes four knowledge types:

```
┌─────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐
│    OPINION      │   │     FACTS       │   │   KNOWLEDGE     │
│   (Judgment)    │   │   (Codebase)    │   │     (Docs)      │
└────────┬────────┘   └────────┬────────┘   └────────┬────────┘
         │                     │                     │
         └─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┘
                               ▼
                      ┌─────────────────┐
                      │  AI SYNTHESIS   │
                      │    (Claude)     │
                      └────────┬────────┘
                               ▼
                      ┌─────────────────┐
                      │    ARTIFACT     │
                      └─────────────────┘
```

## Five Agent Modes

| Mode | When to Use | Prompt Prefix |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Analyst** | Audits, gap analysis | "Act as a rigorous analyst..." |
| **Writer** | Strategy docs, narratives | "Help me write a clear..." |
| **Devil's Advocate** | Stress-testing ideas | "Challenge this. Role-play as..." |
| **Builder** | Tools, prototypes | "Build [X] with this spec..." |
| **Thought Partner** | Brainstorming | "Help me explore the space..." |

## Background

I developed this framework while building clarity for a platform team at Spotify. The team had strong engineering but lacked a clear product identity. Over 4 months, I used AI assistance to:

- Audit 50,000+ lines of code to understand capabilities
- Produce 15+ strategy documents
- Build internal tools
- Prepare for stakeholder conversations

The framework emerged from what actually worked.
