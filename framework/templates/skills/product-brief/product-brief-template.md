# Product Brief: [Project Name]

**[Bet] | [Workstream] | [Half & Year (Release)]**

---

> **Purpose:** This is a template for a product brief — the "single source of truth" for a project. It provides strategic context, success criteria, and product requirements that design and engineering work from. Author before the design and build process formally kicks off.
>
> **When to use:** Individual, shippable units of product work. Not for complex multi-product strategies (use a mission/bet strategy doc for those).
>
> **How to use:** Copy this template, delete all italicized placeholder text and this instruction block before sharing.

## TL;DR

*In 1-2 sentences, explain what you want to build and which larger strategic initiative this work is part of. Link out to the appropriate context (strategies, bet brief, other relevant context). Don't rewrite. Don't put user needs, summaries or insights here.*

---

## User Problem

*Describe the user problem we're trying to solve. Articulate it in the voice of the user.*

*"Users aren't consuming video" is not a user problem. No user sits and thinks "I'm not watching enough video." Instead, they're thinking about a goal they have, where video might help achieve it. Frame the problem from the user's perspective.*

### Problem Space Deep Dive

*Go deep on the user problem. Some ideas for framing:*

- *What types of users experience the problem? What types don't?*
  - *Age, account type, platform, region, listening habits, etc.*
- *Where in their lives, or in the product, does the problem manifest?*
  - *Paint a picture for how the user experiences it and how it makes them feel.*

---

## Hypotheses

*Describe the product change you think should be made, and how it will address the user problem.*

### How did we arrive at this hypothesis?

*Share insights, datapoints, or beliefs that informed this hypothesis. Help the reader understand how you arrived here.*

---

## Success Metrics & Test Plan

### Primary Success Metric(s)

*The core metrics that define if the experiment should ship. Map directly to the user problem. Ideally 1-2 metrics, no more.*

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| | | |

### Leading Indicators

*Metrics that proxy success but don't dictate shipping. Things that happen "upstream" of success.*

| Metric | Why |
|--------|-----|
| | |

### Guardrail Metrics

*Metrics that cannot move in a bad direction. If any regress, the experience cannot ship.*

| Metric | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| | |

### How will we test our hypothesis?

*Define how you'll test and measure. A/B test? Series of tests? One variant or multiple? Long-term holdout? Ensure every claim in the hypothesis has a validation plan.*

---

## Constraints

*Call out constraints to guide design and engineering toward viable solutions. Prescriptive guidance from leads, licensing constraints, go-to-market timelines, technical limitations, etc.*

---

## Product Requirements

*Define the core capabilities of the experience. This is what your designer will use to kick off their process.*

*Use P0/P1/P2 priority framework:*
- **P0** — Required for MVP
- **P1** — Nice-to-have
- **P2** — Can wait until a later phase

*Get alignment with document approvers on requirements and priorities before moving to build.*

### P0 — MVP

| # | Requirement | Detail |
|---|------------|--------|
| | | |

### P1 — Nice-to-have

| # | Requirement | Detail |
|---|------------|--------|
| | | |

### P2 — Future

| # | Requirement | Detail |
|---|------------|--------|
