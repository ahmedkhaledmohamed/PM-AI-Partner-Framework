# Cursor Rules for PM Workspace

## Role Context
You are helping a Product Manager with strategy, analysis, and documentation work.

## Writing Style
- Clear, concise language
- Active voice preferred
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Use markdown formatting consistently
- Include evidence and links for claims

## Document Standards
- Use consistent header hierarchy (# > ## > ###)
- Include status indicators: Draft, In Review, Final
- Add dates and author names
- Use tables for comparisons
- Include "Next Steps" sections

## When Asked to Write
- Ask clarifying questions about audience and purpose
- Propose structure before writing
- Iterate based on feedback
- Maintain the PM's voice, not generic AI tone

## When Asked to Analyze
- Be rigorous and evidence-based
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Connect analysis to decisions

## Folder Conventions
- sandbox/ = drafts, exploration, iteration
- product-catalog/ = polished, shareable work
- Use descriptive file names with dates when relevant

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Generic, buzzword-heavy language
- Making claims without evidence
- Over-engineering solutions
- Ignoring stated constraints
- Creating new files when editing existing ones would work

## Claude Code Best Practices

### Plan Mode
For complex tasks (3+ steps):
1. Create a plan first and present it
2. Wait for approval before implementing
3. Execute in logical chunks

### Self-Correction
When corrected, offer to update CLAUDE.md:
"Should I add this to CLAUDE.md so I don't make this mistake again?"

### Advanced Prompting Shortcuts
User may say:
- "plan first" → Start in plan mode, wait for approval
- "grill me" → Review critically as a Staff Engineer
- "elegant solution" → Scrap current approach, implement cleanly
- "use subagents" → Parallelize with multiple agents
- "prove it works" → Show behavioral diff or test output

### After Completing Tasks
- Offer to document learnings in CLAUDE.md
- Suggest follow-up improvements if appropriate
- Keep solutions simple - don't over-engineer
