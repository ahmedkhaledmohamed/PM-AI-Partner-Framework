# Sandbox: Personal Working Space

## Purpose

This folder is for **drafts, exploration, and iteration**. Nothing here needs to be polished or ready to share.

## What Goes Here

- Early-stage thinking and hypotheses
- Notes from meetings and conversations
- Draft strategy documents
- Analysis work-in-progress
- Experimental ideas

## Document Status

Files here are drafts unless marked `[FINAL]` or `[READY]`.

## Folder Structure (Suggested)

```
sandbox/
├── strategy/      # Mission, charter, value proposition drafts
├── analysis/      # Capability audits, research, investigations
├── planning/      # Roadmaps, priorities, planning docs
├── context/       # Meeting notes, handovers, background
└── _examples/     # Example templates (don't edit)
```

## When Helping

- Preserve existing structure and content
- Add to existing docs rather than creating new ones
- Use markdown tables for comparisons
- Link to evidence when making claims
- Mark assumptions clearly

## Graduation Flow

When a document is ready to share:
1. Review and polish the content
2. Move to `product-catalog/` with appropriate naming
3. Update any links that reference it
