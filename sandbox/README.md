# Sandbox

Your personal working space for drafts, exploration, and iteration.

## Purpose

This is where you think out loud. Nothing here needs to be polished. Use it for:

- **Early hypotheses** that might be wrong
- **Meeting notes** and conversation capture
- **Draft documents** before they're ready
- **Analysis** work-in-progress
- **Exploration** of new ideas

## Suggested Structure

Create subfolders as needed:

```
sandbox/
├── strategy/      # Mission, charter, value drafts
├── analysis/      # Audits, research, investigations
├── planning/      # Roadmaps, priorities
├── context/       # Notes, handovers, background
└── _examples/     # Example templates (reference only)
```

## Workflow

1. **Create** drafts here freely
2. **Iterate** with AI assistance
3. **Graduate** polished docs to `product-catalog/`
4. **Archive** or delete what you don't need

## Privacy

Consider keeping this folder in a **private repo** or adding sensitive files to `.gitignore`.
