This is a **template repository** for Product Managers who want to use AI (Claude) as a structured thinking partner. Fork this repo, customize it for your context, and start working.

## Repository Structure

```
pm-ai-partner-framework/
├── CLAUDE.md              # You are here - root context
├── sandbox/               # Your personal drafts & exploration (private)
├── product-catalog/       # Polished artifacts for sharing (team/public)
├── framework/
│   ├── core/              # Methodology: agent modes, workflows, philosophy
│   └── templates/         # Config files to copy into your workspace
└── docs/                  # GitHub Pages website
```

## Quick Start

1. **Fork this repo** to your account
2. **Copy templates** from `framework/templates/` to your workspace
3. **Start in sandbox/** for drafts, graduate to `product-catalog/` when ready
4. **Use the agent modes** and workflows in `framework/core/`

## How to Use This Context

When working in this repo:
- **Read** `framework/core/pm-ai-partner-framework.md` for the full methodology
- **Use** `framework/core/quick-reference.md` as a daily cheat sheet
- **Copy** prompts from `framework/core/starter-prompts.md`
- **Follow** workflows in `framework/core/workflows/` for specific scenarios

## The Core Principle

> **PM work is reconciling four sources of truth. AI helps you explore each faster and spot conflicts. Judgment stays human.**

| Source | Question | AI Role |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Code | "What CAN happen?" | Explore, map |
| Docs | "What's EXPECTED?" | Synthesize |
| Data | "What IS happening?" | Analyze |
| Judgment | "What SHOULD happen?" | Challenge |

## Agent Modes

Switch between these AI "personalities" based on your task:

| Mode | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| Technical Analyst | Codebase exploration, capability audits |
| Writer | Strategy docs, narratives, communication |
| Devil's Advocate | Stress-testing ideas, preparing for pushback |
| Builder | Creating tools, prototypes, scripts |
| Thought Partner | Brainstorming, exploring options |
| Data Analyst | Metrics analysis, finding patterns |
