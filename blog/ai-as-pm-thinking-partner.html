    <h1>AI as a PM Thinking Partner: A Framework for Rigorous Collaboration</h1>

    <p class="subtitle">How I use Claude to think more clearly, not to write for me</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Four months ago, I inherited a platform team navigating an identity crisis. The engineering was strong — systems were production-grade, serving hundreds of millions of users. But when I asked "what makes us different from the three adjacent teams?" nobody had a crisp answer.</p>

    <p>I needed to build clarity fast while also shipping a roadmap. I couldn't do it alone.</p>

    <p>This is the story of how I built a system for thinking with AI that helped me audit 50,000+ lines of code, produce 15+ strategy documents, and build an internal tool — all while delivering on commitments.</p>

    <p><strong>This isn't about having AI write your work. It's about thinking more rigorously.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Problem: Platform PM Clarity</h2>

    <p>Platform teams have a unique challenge. Unlike product teams with clear user-facing features, platform teams provide infrastructure that others build on. The value is often invisible:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>When things work, the teams you enable get credit</li>
        <li>When things break, you get the questions</li>
        <li>Your "customers" are other engineers and PMs, not end users</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I joined a team where the previous PM had identified the core issue: the team had been "mis-sold" internally. People thought we did one thing when we actually did another. This caused misunderstanding, false starts, and loss of trust.</p>

    <p>My job was to create clarity. But how do you define what a platform team "really does" when even the people on the team aren't sure?</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Insight: Ground Strategy in Code</h2>

    <p>Here's what I realized: <strong>the codebase doesn't lie.</strong></p>

    <p>Strategy documents can be aspirational. Roadmaps can be optimistic. But the code shows what actually exists. If you want to understand what a platform team truly owns, look at what's implemented.</p>

    <p>This became my approach:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Audit the codebase systematically</li>
        <li>Map capabilities to actual code</li>
        <li>Identify gaps between claims and reality</li>
        <li>Build strategy grounded in implementation truth</li>
    </ol>

    <p>But auditing 50,000+ lines of code across multiple repositories? That's where AI became essential.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Framework: Four Sources of Truth</h2>

    <p>I developed a mental model I call <strong>Four Sources of Truth</strong>. PM work is fundamentally about reconciling different types of truth:</p>

    <div class="diagram">
        <pre>┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│    CODE     │  │    DOCS     │  │    DATA     │  │  JUDGMENT   │

│ What CAN    │  │ What's      │  │ What IS     │  │ What        │
│ happen?     │  │ expected?   │  │ happening?  │  │ SHOULD?     │
└──────┬──────┘  └──────┬──────┘  └──────┬──────┘  └──────┬──────┘
       │                │                │                │

                    └──────────┬──────────┘
                               ▼
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │      DECISION       │
                    └─────────────────────┘</pre>
    </div>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Source</th>
                <th>Question Answered</th>
                <th>AI Role</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Code</strong></td>
                <td>"What CAN happen?"</td>
                <td>Explore, map capabilities</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Docs</strong></td>
                <td>"What's EXPECTED?"</td>
                <td>Synthesize, cross-reference</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Data</strong></td>
                <td>"What IS happening?"</td>
                <td>Analyze, find patterns</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Judgment</strong></td>
                <td>"What SHOULD happen?"</td>
                <td>Challenge, structure</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>These sources often <strong>conflict</strong> — which is where PM work gets interesting:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Code ≠ Docs: "We claim to do X but code shows Y"</li>
        <li>Data ≠ Strategy: "Strategy says X matters, metrics show Y"</li>
        <li>Judgment ≠ Data: "I think X, but data shows Y"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The key principle:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <strong>PM work is reconciling four sources of truth. AI helps you explore each source faster and spot conflicts between them. Judgment about what SHOULD happen stays human.</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The System: Six Agent Modes</h2>

    <p>I realized different tasks need different AI "personalities." I mentally switch between six modes:</p>

    <h3>1. Technical Analyst Agent</h3>

    <p>For codebase exploration and capability audits. Rigorous, systematic, skeptical.</p>

    <p><em>"Act as a rigorous analyst. Examine this code and build a systematic assessment of what capabilities exist. Question my assumptions."</em></p>

    <h3>2. Writer Agent</h3>

    <p>For strategy docs and narratives. Clear, structured, audience-aware.</p>

    <p><em>"Help me write a clear team charter for leadership. The key message is [X]. Here are my rough notes..."</em></p>

    <h3>3. Devil's Advocate Agent</h3>

    <p>For stress-testing ideas before presenting them. Constructively critical.</p>

    <p><em>"Role-play as a skeptical director. What are the strongest objections to this strategy? What questions would you ask?"</em></p>

    <h3>4. Builder Agent</h3>

    <p>For creating tools and prototypes. Technical, iterative, practical.</p>

    <p><em>"I want to build [X]. Here's the spec. Generate the scaffold, then we'll iterate."</em></p>

    <h3>5. Thought Partner Agent</h3>

    <p>For brainstorming and exploration. Open-ended, generative.</p>

    <p><em>"Help me explore this space. What are different ways to think about this problem? What am I not considering?"</em></p>

    <h3>6. Data Analyst Agent</h3>

    <p>For metrics exploration and insight generation. Pattern-finding.</p>

    <p><em>"I have this data: [metrics/results]. Help me identify patterns, generate hypotheses for what's happening, and suggest what to investigate next."</em></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Workflow: Strategic Clarity</h2>

    <p>Here's the specific workflow I used to define my team's identity:</p>

    <h3>Phase 1: Absorb (Week 1)</h3>

    <p>Read everything — handovers, history, existing docs. Use AI to synthesize themes.</p>

    <p><em>"I've inherited this team. Here's what I've learned. Help me identify key themes and tensions."</em></p>

    <h3>Phase 2: Audit (Week 2)</h3>

    <p>Systematic codebase review. Use AI to map capabilities to code.</p>

    <p><em>"I'm a PM trying to understand this code's product meaning, not implementation. What capability does this represent?"</em></p>

    <h3>Phase 3: Articulate (Week 3)</h3>

    <p>Draft identity, boundaries, value proposition. Use AI to structure.</p>

    <p><em>"Based on my audit, here's what we own vs. don't own. Help me draft a clear mission statement."</em></p>

    <h3>Phase 4: Align (Week 4)</h3>

    <p>Socialize with stakeholders. Use AI to prepare for pushback.</p>

    <p><em>"I'm presenting this charter to [stakeholder]. Role-play as them. What would you push back on?"</em></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Results</h2>

    <p>Using this system over four months, I:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Audited 5 major codebases</strong> — Created a 240-line capability audit with evidence links to specific files</li>
        <li><strong>Produced 15+ strategy documents</strong> — Team charter, value narrative, operating guide, master plan</li>
        <li><strong>Built an internal tool</strong> — A catalog builder using iterative AI prompts (7 steps, days instead of weeks)</li>
        <li><strong>Prepared for key conversations</strong> — 290-line dev talk preparation document</li>
    </ul>

    <p>More importantly, the team now has <strong>clarity</strong>. We can articulate what we own, what we don't, and why it matters. When stakeholders ask "what do you do?" we have a crisp answer grounded in reality.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Anti-Patterns</h2>

    <p>What doesn't work:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>❌ Don't</th>
                <th>Why It Fails</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>"Write me a strategy doc"</td>
                <td>No direction = generic output</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Accept first draft</td>
                <td>Always needs human refinement</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Skip codebase grounding</td>
                <td>Strategy disconnected from reality</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Use AI for judgment calls</td>
                <td>Can't know your organizational context</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>One mega-prompt</td>
                <td>Iterative works better</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The key mistakes are expecting AI to replace your judgment or accepting outputs without critical review. AI amplifies your preparation — garbage in, garbage out.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Takeaway</h2>

    <p>AI hasn't changed <em>what</em> PMs do. It's changed <em>how fast</em> we can think rigorously about complex problems.</p>

    <p>The framework I've described isn't magic. It's a system for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Providing clear direction to AI</li>
        <li>Iterating quickly on outputs</li>
        <li>Grounding strategy in implementation reality</li>
        <li>Preparing for conversations systematically</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you're a PM dealing with ambiguity — whether that's a new role, an unclear team scope, or a complex technical domain — try this approach:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pick one messy problem</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Choose an agent mode</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Iterate with AI</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Own the output</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The goal isn't to have AI write your documents. It's to think more rigorously, communicate more clearly, and move faster — while keeping judgment human.</p>
